### Study Buddy (Client Side)

### Fixes to make
* :x: The counts in the left panel tags aren't incrementing :-/
* :x: Decide where changes to metadata should be done. Should you leave that to the server, or should AppManager handle metadata and send an upload at the end?
* :x: Implement a PQ in AppManager.cardHasBeenModified. Or is it more efficient to do this at the server?
* :white_checkmark: Although CardManager is controlled, make it somewhat autonomous.

#### To-Do Items
* Have some artwork to fill in the blank space in the login page.
    * <img src="https://github.com/dchege711/study_buddy/blob/master/images/login_whitespace.png" width="700px" height="400px">
* :white_check_mark: Fix the side bar to go under the navigation bar.
