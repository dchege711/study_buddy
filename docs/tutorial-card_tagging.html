    <h1>Tags Management</h1>
<p>The app should help the user use the fewest tags possible while still being descriptive. We address this problem in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing autocompletion for tags based on the prefix.</li>
<li>Suggesting related tags based on previous usage patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Near Neighbor Search in Tags Graph</h2>
<p>Given the tags used by a user in their cards, we construct an undirected graph of tags where an edge between tag #A and #B indicate that tags #A and #B have appeared on the same card together. The weight of the</p>
<h2>Level 2</h2>
<p>I can also provide some naive suggestions based on how similar/related tags are. There are two ways of determining this.</p>
<p>I can infer similarity based on how tags have been used in the past, e.g. if the user types <code>trees</code>, and there's already a card that has <code>trees, data_structures, search</code> as tags, I should recommend <code>data_structures</code> and <code>search</code> as well. This looks like a graph problem.</p>
<p>It's also possible to build a graph of words based on an external dataset. Such a graph would have nodes like <code>markov_chain</code> and <code>probability</code> connected by an edge with a greater weight than say <code>markov_chain</code>--&gt;<code>poisson</code>. This approach can suggest tags that have not been used before. However, this 'knowledge graph' isn't readily available. I might have to make it myself.</p>
