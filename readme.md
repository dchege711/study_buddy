* Changes made to initial design:
    * The web client runs on ReactJS, but still on Heroku.
    * I'm using mLab's MongoDB service instead of Google Cloud SQL because of cost.
    * The backend logic is written in NodeJS, not in Python.

### Tasks 
* Implement the email address as the unique identifier.
* Learn how to do email verification.
* Time the login denials and set the response times so that one can't distinguish between false usernames and false passwords.
* :white_check_mark: Implement the log-in process on the server side.
* :white_check_mark: Figure out how to use config variables in ReactJS scripts, e.g. accessing metadata (Did this on server side)
