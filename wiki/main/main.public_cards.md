We think that a user can benefit from other users' cards. For instance, in a class setting, seeing flashcards that other people made for the same class can complement your own collection.

A private flashcard is only visible to its owner. It will not appear in the search results at the `/browse` page. In contrast, a public card will appear in the search results as a read-only card. Any user that adds the card to their own collection will get a separate copy of the card.

## Toggling Private/Public State of Cards

- For each card, we provide a switch to toggle between its private/public state.
- In the account management page, we give the user an option to set a default privacy setting for new cards. By default cards are private.

## Sharing Links to Cards

- For now, we display a shareable URL that opens in the `/browse` page if the card still exists and is public.

## Moderating Content

- With public cards, it's possible that some malicious users may upload objectionable cards. While we don't delete users' cards against their will, we don't have an obligation to help them share such cards. When a card gets flagged as inappropriate, it is excluded from search results in the `/browse` page.
