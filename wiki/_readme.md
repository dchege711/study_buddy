I wrote this application mainly for me. In college, I used to divide my notebook into two columns. In the right column, I'd take class notes. In the left column, I'd have questions whose answers were the content on the right. Revising for exams was convenient - cover up the right side and answer the questions on the left.

Granted, apps like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/en), [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/), [Makandra Cards](https://makandracards.com/), [Mochi Cards](https://mochi.cards/) exist. I prefer my app mainly because I have designed it as I see fit, and I keep tweaking it in my free time. I avail the code that runs the app in case you're interested in peeking under the hood too.

Feel free to send me bugs, feature requests and feedback, either [on Github](https://github.com/dchege711/study_buddy/issues) or at d.chege711(at)gmail[dot]com.
